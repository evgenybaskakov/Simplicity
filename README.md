Simplicity
==========

Simplicity is a mail client for Mac.

It will replace the Mail.app on my Mac eventually.

Planned features:

- Fast folder-oriented interface;
- Hidden (unused) and popular folders;
- Folder color marks;
- Message threads with collapsible cells;
- Search in folder/mailbox;
- Search history;
- Search in any of previous search results;
- Highlighting search patterns in the found messages;
- Undo/redo for as many mail operations as possible;
- Small local message database;
